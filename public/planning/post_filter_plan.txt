// When you call the PostIndex element, pass in a filter prop (if you need to filter)

**** Inside PostIndex Element ****
// pull in filter from props => const { filter } = props
// pass filter array in with the axios.get request


**** Inside Rails posts#create ****
// pull in :filter param (or however it will be sent over)
// if filter = empty array => Post.all search
// if filter not empty => build active record query based on the filter
